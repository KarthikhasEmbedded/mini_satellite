PocketSat â€” Tiny satellite-style telemetry with a Raspberry Pi Pico: real-time sensors, SD logging, and a live dashboard.
ðŸ“– Overview

PocketSat is a miniature satellite prototype built using a Raspberry Pi Pico and multiple sensors. The project demonstrates how a small embedded platform can collect, log, and visualize real-time telemetry data â€” similar to how CubeSats and IoT nodes work in space or environmental monitoring.

The system reads data from motion, atmospheric, and air-quality sensors, logs everything onto an SD card, and provides a real-time dashboard for monitoring trends and performance.

âš¡ Features

ðŸ›° Multi-sensor telemetry (MPU6050, BMP180, MQ-2)

ðŸ’¾ Onboard SD card logging for mission data

ðŸ“Š Real-time dashboard for live visualization

ðŸ”„ Modular design â€” add more sensors like GPS, radio, or solar monitoring

ðŸŽ“ Great for learning embedded systems, IoT, and satellite concepts

ðŸ”§ Hardware Used

Raspberry Pi Pico

MPU6050 â€“ accelerometer & gyroscope

BMP180 â€“ pressure & temperature sensor

MQ-2 â€“ gas & air-quality sensor

SD card module
